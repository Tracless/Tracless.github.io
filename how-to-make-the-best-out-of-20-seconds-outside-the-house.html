            How to make the best out of 20 seconds outside the house
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            No little kitten wants to leave his warm house and walk into the cold wild, but there comes the time where a kitten doesn´t know if it wants to be inside, outside or both at the same time. For the rare case that we really step outside, here are 5 survival tips on how to make the best out of it.    
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>1. You don´t have to go far away from the house. Stay nearby!</strong><br>
            Too many kittens make the mistake to actually think that they have to go around and explore the world while being sent outside. The simple trick is to stay aside of the house for about 5 minutes, then jump back on the window or enter through the cat-door and the owner won´t ask questions.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>2. Test the emotional bond between you and your human slave!</strong><br>
            If you are sent outside, either if you asked for it or human just decided to, try to look very frigthened and sad. Some humans will feel guilty and put you back inside your warm home.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>3. Avoid the natural enemies of kittens!</strong> <br>
            Kittens, although they follow a long path through the path of evolution, have everlasting enemies, which they have to avoid under all circumstances. Extreme weather, like snow, rain, cold temperatures, semi cold temperatures, not warm enough, foggy, too dark, too bright, windy, or a mix of all them together, are the biggest threat to a kittens life. If you can, try to go outside, when the weather is fine, meaning 24.3°C in the shadow, 27.6°C in the sun, humidity of 46.3%, wind blowing with 3.6 km/h and a grass height of 2.4 cm. Very important: Only leave the house under those circumstances.

            <strong>4. Try to build a kitten-gang around your hood!</strong> <br>
            As a kitten, you are not alone in this world, and you need a group of friends to survive outside in the cold world. And you need friends to beat the heck out of Team Instinct, while you are on it. A gang-like mentality and organisation of your neighbourhood enables scheduled mouse hunting events, regular vegetable and fruit markets and the possibility to make a cat choir.

            <strong>5. Bend the spacetime continuum to your needs!</strong> <br>
            If you are perhaps a leading expert on kitten quantum technologies, it might be in your favour to bend the spacetime continuum to make your time outside the house only last a total of 2 second on your end, while the catslave measures the time frame as up to 34 seconds, a huge advantage for the average quantum kitten!
