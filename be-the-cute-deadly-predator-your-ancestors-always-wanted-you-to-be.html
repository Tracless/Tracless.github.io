            Be the cute, deadly predator your ancestors always wanted you to be
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            The age of hunting and survival is gone, kitties live a decent life with a steadily rising life-expectancy. Although primal insticts are still present in modern kitties, the thrill of the hunt sleeps deep inside of that fluffy ball. Learn how to release the beast inside  of you.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            Every kitten tries to uphold the fascade of being a littly cutie to get the amounts of petting sessions they need, but the reality looks different. Kittens, formerly knows as fearless sabertoothed cats, are meant to be silent hunters at night, lurking on their prey, killing without hesitation. But evolution said no, and therefore fluffy balls of fur developed through the ages on mankind.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            The ages of "fight or flight" are gone, but little kittens can still remain as deadly hunters, if they are willing to be so. Switch up your prey to match present animals. Instead of going for the 3.5 tons heavy mammoth, try to slay the grasshoper near your favorite tree. DonÂ´t try to hunt velociraptors, instead go for this dangerously looking flying bug which has annoyed you for the past 26 minutes.

            Cute yet deadly to a small amount of tiny insects.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            You also have to keep yourself in shape, always prepared to start hunting in the wild. Sharpen your claws regulary, at you nearest tree of comfort, on the benches in front of the house, or even at that new leather couch your human-slaves bought.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            Always remember: Kittens are amongst the most deadly and vicious animals on this planet. Nothing can nor will stand in your path of obliteration and this little woolball which you like playing with. Represent this extreme lifestyle by offering your human a mouse as generous gift from time to time, and bring it into the house for him to take a look at it.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            In conclusion: Cats are most likely the biggest threat to any living being on earth, even to some funny looking branch which is moving in weird circles while human slave is nearby. Demonstrate your sheer power and dexterity and make your ancestors proud of their fluffy heritage.
