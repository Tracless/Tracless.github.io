            Results
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>1-7 points</strong> You don´t like cats and they don´t like you. You also seem to be happy with your life as it is now. There is no possible risk that you end up with a bunch of cats.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>8-14 points</strong> Cats seem to be more of a gimmick for you. You are happy to have them in your life, but they aren´t a big part of it. The risk for an addiction is small, although there.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>15-21 points</strong> Cats are fascinating and your life isn´t running that great. Cats could give you the love you need and take you off the money you don´t have. You probably end up with some cats.
        </p>
        <p  class="fullarticle">
            <strong>22+ points</strong> Cats are the best and only thing that happened in your life. Without them your heart would create a physically working black hole. Your life without cats is meaningless and you know it. Your future self will have a diagnosable psychosis and addiction to fur.
