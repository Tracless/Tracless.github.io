            <p class="singlearticletitle">The meaning of kitten life</p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Humans have the urge to look for a meaning in their life, instead of living through their day. It is even more problematic for kittens as they life a shorter life than most humans, although still longer than the modern guinea pigs. We want to tell you how to have a fulfilling kitten life in addition to the action you expect from the Twilight Saga.
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                The most important part in todays kitten life is to sleep and eat as much as you can. Try to sleep during the day and only enter the house between 2 and 4 o´clock in the morning. If humans dont wake up to let you in, bite them in the morning to let them know how they can improve themselves. </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Eating is very, if not even more important than sleeping. You are the master kitten, the most important family member. It is your job to disregard any catfood and to only eat the finest meat from the local butcher. When you are done eating, bury the leftovers with the imaginary leaves around while simultaneously scratching the parquet floor. Release the beast inside you while you are still young. </p>

            </div>
            <p class="fullarticle">
               But you don´t have to stop here! Go further by living the adventurous life which the world has to offer. Ever thought about pooping on the new carpet in the night? Do it, you deserve it. What about defending your self-claimed territory? Go outside while others are sleeping and defend your home from other kittens. While doing so, make sure to be loud enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood. Spectators are always welcome when it comes to such spectacular rivalries.
            </p>
           
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Ever tried to get into the field of interior design? Test your skills by scratching every piece of wood you can find in your home. Human will be thankful for your thoughtful input.
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Family is also an integral part of a modern kittens life. Blend into your environment by eating the same food as your humans do. To do some, simly sit on the table during lunch and annoy them until you get your fair share of the meal. This should teach them and prevent further useless discussions about your position in this family.
                
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Lastly, try to give something back to the community. As a kitten, you owe them nothing of course, but to show some kind of gratitude while also showing off your hunting skills, bring the tiniest mouse you can find into humans home. They will show nothing else than love, respect and thankfulness.
