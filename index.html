            <p class="articlesheader">Why having 10 or more little kittens is socially acceptable</p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Baby kittens are well known as nature´s spring of cuteness and fluff. In the earlier ages of mankind, Konfuzius already said: "The one who has the kitten, has no kitten. The kitten has him". Thus one can safely assume that kittens have a positive effect on a human´s life, at least somehow, maybe.
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                Nonetheless kitten scientist found out, that there is a direct correlation between happiness and the amount of kittens in your basement. While one or two kittens increase your bloodpressure and regulary test your sanity, a number of 3 or more kittens have proven to let you forget about your privat problems and your stress at work, while focusing on your new problems, the kittens themselves. </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                This concept of problem shifting has found many implementations in everyday life, mostly in politics.</p>

                But why should every person have at least 5 kittens at home? Why isn´t this the job of the crazy catlady of your city? The answer is quite simple. It´s the job of the human race to obey their kitten masters. As a well educated kitten slave, possibly with a degree and a steady income, it is your job to fulfill the wishes of your cats. But be warned, not all kittens just want belly rubs, food and attention 24/7. Some of them want to achieve world domination, some might want to make a journey around the globe, some want to sit on you keyboard while you are writing kitten articles, and some just want to be assholes.  
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                While you are serving, ehm supporting your kitten family, you can also collect karma which you can maybe somewhen somehow somewhere exchange for something else not clear yet.
            </p>
            <p class="fullarticle">
                And as you see by now, the advantages of having a huge amount of kittens are extraordinary if not to say glorious. Every person on this planet should get kittens himself, as much as possible, and serve them for their lifetime. Because they are the master race this planet deserves.
